# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:
It's a statement that uses if/else and checks for a condition to be true or false. Then it performs an action based on the result of the condition check.

Researched answer:
Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
Git is a system that allows people to contribute to the same code. Github is a particular program that uses git to allow developers to share their code and work together on it.

Researched answer:
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is used to track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
Equality operators (==, ===), logical operators (&&, ||, !), and Relational operators (>, <, etc)

Researched answer:

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a place in an array or string where a value is. Arrays and strings are zero-indexed. A value is a piece of data that lives in that place.

Researched answer:  

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are comma-separated elements. The elements can be any data-type that is accepted by Javascript. Strings are a data type that contains characters between quotation marks. Both arrays and strings are zero-indexed.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is when two people work on the same piece of code at the same time. One person is the driver - they set up the file and do the typing. The second person is the navigator - they do research and tell the driver what to type. The pair work together on figuring out what code to use and communicate as they go along. However, the driver mostly types as the navigator watches for typos, errors, etc and directs the driver as they type. It's a way of solving issues together and insuring there are fewer errors in the final code. The driver/navigator positions are switched on a regular basis as the code is written.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments, returns a function as its result. (All other functions are first-order functions)

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. Jest was created by Facebook and used by Twitter, Spotify, and Airbnb.

3. Objects: Objects are the intersection of data and behavior. An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

4. Method: A method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

5. Classes: Classes are the blueprint or templates for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions. They are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects.
