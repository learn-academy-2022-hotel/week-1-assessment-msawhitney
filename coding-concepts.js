// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: It will add "indigo" to the array and return the length of the new array.
// b) Verify and explain:

// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer:It will return the length of the string which includes the space. (10)
// b) Verify and explain: I was correct.

// --------------------2) What will this log?
//
// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])
//
// // a) Your answer: It will return the letter o, which is at the index place 4.
// // b) Verify and explain: I was correct.
//
// --------------------3) What will this log?
//
// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer:It will return the word Ruby which is at index place 1.
// b) Verify and explain: I was correct.
//
//--------------------4) What will this log?
//
// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// // a) Your answer: It will return SATURDAY and SUNDAY, or the number 2.
// // b) Verify and explain: It returned an error because .toUpperCase is not a function. I was wrong - but on the right track. I knew something was off, but I didn't know what! ;)
//
// --------------------5) What will this log?
//
// const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)
//
//a) Your answer: It will return the number 4 which is the length of the array called dataTypes. (Or error)
// b) Verify and explain: It returned the datatype "number" because that is what was asked for and the number was the length of the array called dataTypes.
